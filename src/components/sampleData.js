Golden Pothos are recognizable by their medium, green, heart-shaped leaves, often streaked or flecked with yellow variegation. While pothos can survive in very low light, the lack of sun can make the leaves return to a solid green and lose their yellow colouring. This tropical beaut will be happiest in an area where it recieves medium to high light.",
